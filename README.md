# The Impact of Universal Public Preschool on Maternal Education Outcomes: Evidence from Florida and Washington, DC
The data, code, and write up for my Capstone project. Analysis of the impact of state preschool programs on maternal educational outcomes in DC and Florida.

The full ACS dataset is too large to upload, but is available through IPUMS. Follow this link: https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/group

You can select any variable and sample. In my full dataset, I include the following variables (in addition to automatically selected variables): STATEICP, HHINCOME, YNGCH, SEX, AGE, MARST, RACE, EDUC, EDUCD. I download samples from the years 2005-2014.


The cleaned Florida data is also too large to uplaod. You can access it through this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LLLeF_V0hKAL0gHf8kQuSUJ5D3ptfFfR/view?usp=sharing
